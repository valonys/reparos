# DigiTwin Application - Future Enhancements

## Overview
This document outlines planned enhancements for the DigiTwin application to improve performance, data management, and user experience through advanced analytics and AI capabilities.

---

## 1. Data Preprocessing Module

### Objective
Create a dedicated preprocessing module to optimize dataset size and improve application performance by removing unnecessary columns and cleaning data before storage.

### Implementation Plan

#### 1.1 Column Analysis & Removal
- **Module**: `preprocessing.py`
- **Functionality**:
  - Analyze uploaded Excel files for column usage patterns
  - Identify and remove columns with:
    - High percentage of null values (>80%)
    - Redundant information
    - Non-essential metadata
  - Preserve critical columns: FPSO, Main WorkCtr, Notification Type, Location, Keywords, etc.

#### 1.2 Data Cleaning Pipeline
```python
def preprocess_notifications_data(df):
    """
    Preprocess notification data to reduce size and improve quality
    """
    # Remove unnecessary columns to improve memory footprint
    columns_to_remove = [
        'Priority',           # Redundant priority information
        'Notification',       # Duplicate notification data
        'Order',             # Order information not needed for analytics
        'Planner group'       # Planner group metadata
    ]
    
    # Remove specified columns
    df = df.drop(columns=columns_to_remove, errors='ignore')
    
    # Clean data types
    # Remove duplicates
    # Standardize text fields
    # Optimize memory usage
    
    return cleaned_df
```

#### 1.3 Benefits
- **Reduced Database Size**: Removal of Priority, Notification, Order, and Planner group columns reduces dataset size by 15-25%
- **Improved Performance**: Faster loading and processing times due to reduced memory footprint
- **Better Memory Management**: Optimized data types and structures for cached database
- **Data Quality**: Consistent formatting and validation while preserving essential analytics columns
- **Focused Analytics**: Streamlined dataset containing only relevant columns for FPSO analysis

## 2. Feature Engineering Enhancements

### Objective
Enhance the dataset with derived features to provide deeper insights and better analytics capabilities.

### Implementation Plan

#### 2.1 Main WorkCtr Feature Engineering
- **Categorization**: Group work centers into logical categories
- **Priority Levels**: Assign priority based on work center type
- **Frequency Analysis**: Track most common work centers per FPSO

#### 2.2 Additional Feature Engineering
```python
def engineer_features(df):
    """
    Create new features from existing data
    """
    # Time-based features
    df['notification_age_days'] = (pd.Timestamp.now() - df['date']).dt.days
    df['is_urgent'] = df['notification_age_days'] <= 7
    
    # Location-based features
    df['location_category'] = categorize_location(df['location'])
    df['is_critical_area'] = is_critical_location(df['location'])
    
    # Keyword-based features
    df['keyword_count'] = df['keywords'].str.count(',') + 1
    df['has_safety_keyword'] = df['keywords'].str.contains('safety|emergency', case=False)
    
    # FPSO-specific features
    df['fpso_notification_density'] = df.groupby('fpso')['notification_id'].transform('count')
    
    return df
```

#### 2.3 New Features to Add
- **Temporal Features**:
  - Notification age (days since creation)
  - Urgency indicators
  - Seasonal patterns
  
- **Spatial Features**:
  - Location categories (Deck, Hull, Machinery, etc.)
  - Critical area flags
  - Zone-based grouping
  
- **Operational Features**:
  - Work center complexity scores
  - Resource allocation indicators
  - Maintenance priority levels

## 3. LLM Integration with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

### Objective
Implement conversational AI capabilities to allow users to query the cached dataset using natural language, providing intelligent insights and recommendations.

### Implementation Plan

#### 3.1 RAG Architecture
```python
class DigiTwinRAG:
    """
    RAG system for querying notification data
    """
    def __init__(self, db_path):
        self.db_path = db_path
        self.vector_store = None
        self.llm_model = None
        
    def setup_vector_store(self):
        """Create vector embeddings for notification data"""
        # Load data from SQLite
        # Create embeddings using sentence-transformers
        # Store in vector database (Chroma/FAISS)
        
    def query_notifications(self, user_query):
        """Process natural language queries"""
        # Retrieve relevant documents
        # Generate response using LLM
        # Return formatted results
```

#### 3.2 LLM Model Integration
- **Model Options**:
  - **Local**: Llama 2, Mistral, or similar open-source models
  - **Cloud**: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, or Azure OpenAI
  - **Hybrid**: Local for basic queries, cloud for complex analysis

#### 3.3 Query Capabilities
```python
# Example queries the system should handle:
queries = [
    "Show me all urgent notifications from the last week",
    "Which FPSO has the most safety-related issues?",
    "What are the common keywords in deck maintenance notifications?",
    "Compare notification patterns between PAZ and DAL FPSOs",
    "Generate a summary of critical maintenance needs",
    "What work centers require immediate attention?"
]
```

#### 3.4 Implementation Steps
1. **Vector Database Setup**:
   - Install and configure vector database (Chroma/FAISS)
   - Create embeddings for notification text
   - Index metadata fields

2. **LLM Integration**:
   - Set up model API connections
   - Create prompt templates
   - Implement response formatting

3. **User Interface**:
   - Add chat interface to Streamlit app
   - Display query results with visualizations
   - Provide query suggestions

4. **Response Enhancement**:
   - Generate charts and graphs from queries
   - Provide actionable insights
   - Link to relevant data views
